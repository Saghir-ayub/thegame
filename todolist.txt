Figure out how to update score for different users // DONE

Add in different game modes: // DONE
	Endurance mode (more info further down) // DONE
	timer - survive as long as possible mode? countdown timer mode? // DONE
	race - words spawn after 1 is killed or reaches bottom? pre-spawn next 2 words?) // DONE

Dynamically link scoring update system to different langauges // DONE


Endurance mode:
Have a dynamically updated custom game choice interface, square blocks with name/levels/groups;
	paint image "CustomeGameChoiceInterface.jpg" <-- to be made

Implement combo tracker (resets when wrong increments when word entered increases score) // DONE

Give effects depending on combo breaker at intervals of 5/10/20, activatable button maybe? effect on click; // DONE
	5 = slow down speed for x seconds, points per regular word + 1 // DONE
	10 = freeze all words for x seconds, points per regular word + 2 // NEEDS IMPLEMENTING
	20 = spawn a group of words to screen for x seconds, frozen for some time, on correct entry 10x points // NEEDS IMPLEMENTING
	50 (nightmaremode only) = One time unlock of something, unique per level, something worth hunting,
		displayed in achievments 

pick speed, add in booster words (slow down/freeze words when entered, adds lives, traverses 
	through levels as you get certain amount right, random spawns)

Custom game modes:
Add in a custom game mode, chooses levels to combine together/play words by their group (dynamic dropdown?)
Figure out how to import CSV files as a custom game mode

sql commands to add:
//// score per level of each type of gamemode
SELECT userChineseLevels.'RegularScore', userChineseLevels.'BeatTheClockScore', userChineseLevels.'RaceToFinishScore',
userChineseLevels.'EnduranceScore', userChineseLevels.'PracticeScore'
FROM userChineseLevels WHERE userChineseLevels.'UserID' = 'bubness' GROUP BY userChineseLevels.'Level'

//// total regularmode RegularScore
SELECT sum(UserChineseLevels.RegularScore) FROM UserChineseLevels WHERE UserChineseLevels.UserID = 'bubness'

//// descending order of last 25 correct words
SELECT WordID FROM UserChineseWords WHERE UserID = 'bubness' AND DATE IS NOT NULL ORDER BY Date DESC limit 25
